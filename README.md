Open WEB spider aimed to solve common task of downloading the entire content of WEB-site and allow on-fly post-processing of content.
Planned features are

 - extract data using XPath expressions from not well-formed HTML pages or XHTML ones
 - maintain website graph (links between ancestor / successor pages)
 - process websites behind the authentication (HTTP Basic/Digest, Form-Based authentication)
 - handle failures and restart processing from point where application was aborted
 - provide extension API for document type handlers, protocol handlers
 - concurrent processing of website pages
 - minimize traffic using bzip/gzip encoding when possible, avoid donloading of same link twice or more times
